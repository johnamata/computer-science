* About

To lessen the number of github repos I have, I combined my HtDP and SICP repos into this one repo. They are found on the "solutions" directory. I'm also using this repo to play with some toy Racket/Lisp projects, they are found on the "toys" directory

HtDP - contains my solutions for the book How to Design Programs

SICP - contains my solutions for the book Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
