To lessen the number of github repos I have, I've combined my HtDP and SICP repos into this one repo. 

HtDP - contains my solutions for the book How to Design Programs

SICP - contains my solutions for the book Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

In the future, once I've finished significant parts of the book, I'll likely use this repo again for advanced studies on Racket/Lisp/Scheme using some of the uni courses from the authors of the books. 

Also: I'll be using this repo for future lisp studies as well.
