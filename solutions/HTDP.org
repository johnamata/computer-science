my notes for the book "How to Design Programs

* Fixed Sized Data
** Functions and Programs
*** COMPOSITION and AUXILIARY
- Typically, programs consist of a main definition and several other functionstypically, programs consist of a main function as well as other programs that turns the output of 1 function as input for another
- this is called COMPOSITION, in analogy to algebra
- and the additional functions are called AUXILIARY FUNCTIONS
*** DEFINE ONE FUNCTION PER TASK
- one function per task and one main function that puts it all together
- to get small programs and composition that's easy to understand
- organized collection of small functions are easier to work with than a large MONOLITHIC block
